- I achieved all base and a few stretch requirements
- i tried to implement a try catch, but found it messed with the fetch command so decided to omit it.
- try/catch effect on an awaited fetch
- How good/bad is my placement of different parts of the website for usability?
- mostly just mdn
- don't remember any specific errors i had, other than the one solved in class (defining a variable twice in an if loop, fixed by declaring it outside the loop, globally).
- inital creation of the game didnt take very long, but i didnt manage to implement as many stretch features as i would've liked
